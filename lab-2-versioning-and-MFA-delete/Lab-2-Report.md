# AWS S3 Lab 2 Report: Versioning & MFA Delete  

**Name:** Cletus-Nehinlalei-Mangu  
**Course:** DevOps Training - Solutions Architect Associate Preparation

## Introduction  
In this lab, I explored Amazon S3 **versioning** and **MFA Delete** features. I created a versioning-enabled bucket, uploaded multiple versions of the same file, experimented with delete markers, and restored objects. I also documented the security implications of MFA Delete and analyzed the cost and operational considerations of versioning in real-world use.

## Lab Objectives Met  
Here’s what I achieved in the lab:  

- Created a versioning-enabled bucket: **`cnm-lab2-versioning-20250819`** in **us-east-1**.  
- Generated multiple versions of the same object through repeated uploads.  
- Demonstrated delete marker behavior and object restoration.  
- Documented MFA Delete requirements and security benefits.  
- Analyzed the storage and operational impacts of enabling versioning.

## What Worked Well  

- **Bucket configuration:** Versioning was enabled successfully, and the status showed correctly in the *Properties* tab.  
- **Version management:** Uploading the same file multiple times created unique versions with system-generated version IDs.  
  - Version 1: *"Version 1 content - Initial upload"*  
  - Version 2: *"Version 2 content - Updated by Cletus-Nehinlalei-Mangu"*  
- **Delete marker behavior:**  
  1. Deleting an object created a delete marker instead of removing it.  
  2. Previous versions remained intact.  
  3. Object appeared deleted in normal view but was recoverable.  
- **Restoration:** Removing the delete marker restored the object instantly, confirming versioning’s protection against accidental deletions.

## Challenges I Faced  

- **Version IDs:** System-generated version IDs were confusing since they cannot be predicted or customized.  
- **Storage costs:** Each version consumes full storage space. For example, a 1GB file with 10 versions uses 10GB. Lifecycle policies are needed for cost control.  
- **Interface navigation:** The *Show versions* toggle in the console wasn’t obvious.  
- **Delete markers:** Initially surprising that deleted objects still consumed space — later understood as protective markers.

## Real-World Application Scenarios  

### Document Management Systems  
1. Automatic backup of revisions during collaboration.  
2. Easy restoration of earlier versions if errors occur.  
3. Audit trail for compliance.  
4. Protection against accidental deletions.  

### Software Development  
1. Build artifacts with automatic version history.  
2. Config files with rollback capability.  
3. Deployment package versioning for release management.  
4. Backup of source code versions.  

### Regulatory Compliance  
1. Maintains audit trails of changes.  
2. Prevents unauthorized deletions.  
3. Ensures data integrity over time.  
4. Supports legal discovery.  

### Content Management  
- Version control for websites and digital assets.  
- Edit history for creative files.  
- Protection of brand assets.  
- Rollback for campaigns and media revisions.

## MFA Delete Security Analysis  

- **Security Enhancement:** MFA Delete requires:  
  - Root user account access (cannot be delegated).  
  - An MFA token for destructive actions.  
  - Explicit confirmation before permanent deletions or disabling versioning.  

  This makes unauthorized deletions much harder, even if credentials are compromised.  

- **Operational Considerations:**  
  - Only the root account can use it.  
  - MFA device failures may block urgent deletions.  
  - Can bottleneck workflows if multiple users need deletion rights.  

- **Compliance Benefits:**  
  - Stronger control over destructive actions.  
  - Audit logs for permanent deletions.  
  - Supports dual authorization requirements.  

- **Risks:**  
  - Root account compromise remains a single point of failure.  
  - Legitimate operations may be delayed.  
  - Harder to integrate into automation workflows.

## Cost and Performance Impact  

- **Storage Costs:**  
  - Each version counts separately.  
  - Without lifecycle policies, costs escalate quickly.  
  - Best practices: limit versions, expire old ones, move older versions to cheaper storage classes.  

- **Performance:**  
  - Upload/download speeds unchanged.  
  - Listing versions may slow with large numbers.  
  - Normal object access unaffected.  

- **Management Overhead:**  
  - Requires lifecycle policies for cleanup.  
  - Teams must be trained in handling versions.  
  - Ongoing monitoring of storage usage is essential.

## Recommendations for Production Use  

- **Version Lifecycle Policies:**  
  - Limit retained versions (e.g., 10 most recent).  
  - Expire old versions (e.g., older than 90 days).  
  - Transition older versions to cheaper storage.  

- **Access Controls:**  
  - Restrict who can enable/disable versioning.  
  - Require MFA Delete for critical buckets.  
  - Regularly review versioning policies.  

- **Monitoring & Alerting:**  
  - Track version growth and storage costs.  
  - Alert on failed deletions or permission errors.  
  - Monitor MFA Delete usage.  

- **Backup Integration:**  
  - Use versioning as the first line of defense.  
  - Combine with backups for disaster recovery.  
  - Consider cross-region replication for resilience.

## Technical Insights  

- **Version IDs:** Base64-encoded, immutable identifiers ensuring data integrity.  
- **Delete Markers:** Zero-byte placeholders with version IDs that mask but don’t erase data.  
- **Restoration Options:**  
  - Delete the delete marker to restore the latest version.  
  - Copy a specific version to make it the current one.
